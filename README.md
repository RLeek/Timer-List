# Timer-List
This is a short hacked-together nearly complete project app made over the holidays to learn swift and apple development. The app is designed to string multiple timers one after the other to allow for multiple played tones over a period of time, these 'timer-lists' can also be set on a loop to repeat multiple times. 

# Missing functionality/Notable bugs:
- App does not run in the background 
- Lack of responsiveness to different screen sizes
- Inability to add notes to timers (Extra planned feature)
- Stopping and resetting the timers will increase the countdown speed
- A timer may still continue and play a tone after it has been stopped/cancelled
- Lack of responsiveness to different screen sizes
