# Timer-List
This is a nearly completed app made to learn swift and app development.

## Motivation
This app is designed to allow several timers to play one after the other. The main motivation for this app was to provide a way of timing multiple small activities easily. E.g. Doing stretching excercises

## Features/How to use
Simply create a timer list and then click the associated object. Separate timers can then be created. The start and stop buttons can then be used to start/stop these timers. 

## Missing functionality/Notable bugs:
- App does not run in the background
